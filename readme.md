# Pokedex!! 

Pokemon served as a major cornerstone for my childhood growing up, I vividly recall watching the very first two episodes on my Gameboy at the time. Throughtout the years I would have moments of nostalgia, the bittersweet feelings of remmebering good memories that I associated with Pokemon. Pokemon wasn't just a game for me, it was a period in my life that serves as a rememberance.

The purpose of this website was for me to pay a tribute to something that I have held dear to me since I was a young child. A homage of some sort, I want this website to act as a guide to those who have no previous knowledge on Pokemon, I hope you enjoy and even gain an appreciation for Pokemon just like I had several years ago.
